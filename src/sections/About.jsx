                I'm a passionate software engineer driven by a strong curiosity
                for how modern web products are built and scaled. What started
                as an interest in understanding how the web works has grown into
                a hands-on focus on building full-stack applications with clean
                architecture, reliable data flows, and thoughtful user
                experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've worked extensively with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and
                Next.js on the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL,
                MongoDB, Prisma, and AWS on the backend. I'm comfortable
                designing REST APIs, implementing secure authentication using
                JWT and bcrypt, and managing application state with Redux
                Toolkit. I also use Python when needed and focus on writing
                clean, readable code that other engineers can easily understand
                and build on.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of building applications, I enjoy exploring new tools,
                staying up to date with modern engineering practices, and
                learning from the developer community. I'm always curious about
                better ways to design systems and write maintainable, efficient
                code.
